# Coverage Workflow for rocprofiler-compute in Monorepo

## Overview

This document describes the coverage generation and CDash upload workflow for `rocprofiler-compute` within the super-repo structure.

```

## Workflows

### 1. Manual Coverage Generation (Periodic Update)

Run this periodically to update the coverage baseline:

```bash
# From monorepo root
cd projects/rocprofiler-compute
./utils/update_coverage.sh

# This will:
# - Build with coverage enabled
# - Run all tests
# - Generate coverage.xml
# - Copy/overwrite to coverage/coverage-latest.xml
# - Show instructions for committing
```

### 2. Commit Coverage to Repository

```bash
# From monorepo root
git add projects/rocprofiler-compute/coverage/coverage-latest.xml
git commit -m "rocprofiler-compute: Update coverage to XX.X% line coverage"
git push origin develop
```

### 3. Automatic CDash Upload

When `coverage/coverage-latest.xml` is pushed to `develop` branch:
- GitHub Action triggers automatically
- Uploads coverage to CDash
- Posts summary to GitHub Actions

## Troubleshooting

### Coverage Generation Fails

```bash
#check Python dependencies
pip install coverage pytest pytest-cov

#verify tests can run
cd projects/rocprofiler-compute/build
ctest --verbose
```
